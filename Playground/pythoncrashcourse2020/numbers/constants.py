# CONSTANT
# A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a
# program. Python doesn't have built-in constant types.

# PYTHON PROGRAMMERS USE ALL CAPITAL LETTERS TO INDICATE A VARIABLE AS A CONSTANT...
# meaning it should never be changed:

MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000

# When you want to treat a variable as a constant in your code, make the name of the
# variable in all capital letters.
