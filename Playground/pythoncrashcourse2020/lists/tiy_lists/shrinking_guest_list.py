# 3-7 Shrinking Guest List
# You just found out that your new dinner table won't arrive in time for the dinner, and you
# have space for only two guests.

# Start with your program from 3-6. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can
# invite only two people for dinner.

# Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain
# in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting
# them know you're sorry you can't invite them to dinner.
