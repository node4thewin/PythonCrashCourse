# TRY IT YOURSELF
# Alien Colors #1 - Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
# variable called "alien_color" and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow',
# or 'red'.

# it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color is 'green':
    print("Congratulations, you just earned 5 points!")

if alien_color is 'red':
    print("Oh no, you just killed your best friend!.")
