# REMOVING KEY-VALUE PAIRS
# When you no longer need a piece of information that's stored in a dictionary,
# you can use the "del" statement to completely remove a key-value pair. All
# "del" needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to remove.

# Remove 'points' from the alien_0 dictionary

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
print(alien_0)

del alien_0['points']
print(alien_0)
