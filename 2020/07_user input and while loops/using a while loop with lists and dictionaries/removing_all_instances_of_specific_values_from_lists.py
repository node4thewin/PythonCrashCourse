# REMOVING ALL INSTANCES OF SPECIFIC VALUES FROM A LIST

# In Chapter 3 we used 'remove() to remove a specific value from a list. The 'remove()' function worked because the value we were interested in appeared only once in the list. But what if you want to remove all instances of a value from a list?

# Say you have a list of pets with the value 'cat' repeated several times. To remove all instances of that value, you can run a 'while' loop until 'cat' is no longer in the list, as shown here:

pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']
print(pets)

while 'cat' in pets:
  pets.remove('cat')
  print(pets)

# if you keep it in the loop you can see it dwindle down. If you print outside the while loop you won't see 'cat' at all.

# We start with a list containing multiple instances of 'cat'. After printing the list, Python enters the 'while' loop because it finds the value of 'cat' in the list at least once. Once inside the loop, Python removes the first instance of 'cat', returns to the 'while' line, and then reenters the loop when it finds that 'cat' is still in the list. It removes each instance of 'cat' until the value is no longer in the list, at which point Python exits the loop and prints the list again.
