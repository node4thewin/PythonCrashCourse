# 7-6 Three Exits

# Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or Exercise 7-5 that do each of the following at least once:

# 1. Use a 'conditional test' in the 'while' statement to stop the loop.

# 2. Use an 'active' variable to control how long the loop runs.

# 3. Use a 'break' statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' value.
