# USING 'break' TO EXIT A LOOP

# To exit a 'while' loop immediately without running any remaining code in the loop, regardless of the results of any conditional test, use the 'break' statement. The 'break' statement directs the flow of your program; you can use it to control which lines of code are executed and which aren't, so the program only executes code that you want it to, when you want it to.

# For example, consider a program that asks the user about places they've visited. We can stop the 'while' loop in this program by calling 'break' as soon as the user enters the 'quit' value:

prompt = "\nPlease enter the name of a city you have visited:"
prompt += "\n(Enter 'quit' when you are finished.) "

while True:
  city = input(prompt)

  if city == 'quit':
    break
  else:
    print(f"I'd love to go to {city.title()}!")

# A loop that starts with 'while True' (line 10) will run forever unless it reaches  a 'break' statement. The loop in this program continues asking the user to enter the names of cities they've been to until they enter 'quit'. When they enter 'quit', the 'break' statement runs, causing Python to exit the loop.

# NOTE - You can use the 'break' statement in any of Python's loops. For example you could use 'break' to quit a 'for' loop that's working through a list or a dictionary.
