# SUMMARY

In this chapter I learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a list. I learned how to work through a list using a 'for' loop, how Python uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a few operations you can perform on numerical lists. You learned how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a slice. You also learned about tuples, which provide a degree or protection to a set of values that shouldn't change, and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read.

In Chapter 5, you'll learn to respond appropriately to different conditions by using 'if' statements. You'll learn to string together relatively complex sets of conditional tests to respons appropriately to exactly the kind of situation or information you're looking for. You'll also learn to use 'if' statements while looping through a list to take specific actions with selected elements from a list.
