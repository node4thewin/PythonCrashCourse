# INDENTING UNNECESSARILY

# If you accidentally indent a line doesn't need to be indented, Python informs you about the unexpected indent:

message = "Hello Python World!"
    print(message)

# You can avoid unexpected indentation errors by indenting only when you have a specific reason to do so. In the programs you're writing at this point, the only lines you should indent are the actions you want to repeat for each item in a 'for' loop.
