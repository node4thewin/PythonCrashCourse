# Part II - Projects

Congratulations! You now know enough about Python to start building interactive and meaningful projects. Creating your own projects will teach you new skills and solidify you understanding of the concepts introduced in Part I.

Part II contains three types of projects, and you can choose to do any or all of these projects in whichever order you like. Here's a brief description of each project to help you decide which to dig into first.

# Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python

In the 'Alien Invasion' project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you'll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you'll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.

# Data Visualization

The Data Visualization project starts in Chapter 15, in which you'll learn to generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly. Chapter 16 teaches you to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots weather data and a map of global earthquake activity. Finally, Chapter 17 shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data. Learning to make visualization allows you to explore the field of data mining, which is a highly sought-after skill in the world today.

# Web Application

In the Web Applications project (Chapters 18, 19, and 20), you'll use the Django package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep a journal about a number of topics they've been learning about. Users will create an account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then make entries about what they're learning. You'll also learn how to deploy your app so anyone in the world can access it.

After completing this project, you'll be able to start building your own simple web applications, and you'll be ready to delve into more thorough resources on building applications with Django.
