# Getting Started with Django

Behind the scenes, today's websites are rich applications that act like fully developed desktop applications. Python has a great set of tools called Django for building web applications. Django is a 'web framework'--a set of tools designed to help you build interactive websites. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use Django (https://djangoproject.com) to build a project called Learning Log--an online journal system that lets you keep track of information you've learned about particular topics.

We'll write a specification for this project, and then we'll define models for the data the app will work with. We'll use Django's admin system to enter some initial data, and then you'll learn to write views and templates so Django can build the site's pages.

Django can response to page requests and make it easier to read and write to a database, manage users, and much more. In Chapters 19 and 20, you'll refine the Learning Log project and then deploy it to a live server so you (and your friends) can use it.
