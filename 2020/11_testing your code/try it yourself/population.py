# 11-2 Population:

# Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, 'population'. Such as 'Santiago, Chile - Population 5000000. Run test_cities.py again. Make sure test_city_country() fails this time.

# This will be called city_functions_modified.py

# Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run test_cities.py again, and make sure test_city_country() passes again.

# Write a second test called 'test_city_country_population()' that verifies you can call your function with the values 'santiago', 'chile', and 'population=5000000'. Run test_cities.py again, and make sure this new test passes.

# This will be called test_cities_modified.py
