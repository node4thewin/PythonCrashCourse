# Testing a Class

In the first part of this chapter, you wrote tests for a single function. Now you'll write tests for a class. You'll use class in many of your own programs, so it's helpful to be able to prove that your classes work correctly. If you have passing tests for a class you're working on, you can be confident that improvements you make to the class won't accidentally break its current behavior.
