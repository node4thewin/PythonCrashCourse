# BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS

# As you learn more about programming, you'll hear the term 'Boolean expression' at some point. A Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional test. A 'boolean value' is either TRUE or FALSE, just like the value of a conditional expression after it has been evaluated.

# Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such as whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on a website:

game_active: True
can_edit: False

# Boolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program or a particular condition that is important to your program.
