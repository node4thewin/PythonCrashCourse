# 5-3 ALIEN COLORS #1

# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called 'alien_color' and assign it to a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

# Write an 'if' statement to test whether the alien's color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

alien_color = 'purple'

if alien_color == 'green':
  print("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points!")
if alien_color == 'red':
  print("Congratulations! You just earned 10 points!")
if alien_color == 'purple':
  print("Congratulations! You just earned 15 points!")

# Write one version of this program that passes the 'if' test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

alien_color = 'orange'

if alien_color == 'green':
  print("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points!")
if alien_color == 'red':
  print("Congratulations! You just earned 10 points!")
if alien_color == 'purple':
  print("Congratulations! You just earned 15 points!")
