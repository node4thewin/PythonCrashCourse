# Styling Your 'if' Statements

In every example in this chapter, you've seen good styling habits. The only recommendation PEP 8 provides for styling conditional tests is to use a single space around comparison operators, such as ==, >=, <=. For example:

if age < 4:

is better than:

if age<4:

Such spacing does not affect the way Python interprets your code; it just makes your code easier for you and others to read.
