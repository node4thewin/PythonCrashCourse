print("Hello Python World!")

# VARIABLES

# Now we will use a variable to in hello_world.py to print "Hello Python World!". Add a new line to the beginning of the file, and modify the second
# line:

message = "Hello Python World!"
print(message)

# We can expand upon this program by modifying hello_world.py to pring a second message. Add a blank line to hello_world.py and then add two new lines
# of code:

message = "Hello Python World!"
print(message)

message = "Hello Python Crash Course World!"
print(message)

# You can change the value of a variable at anytime. Python will always keep track of it's current value.
