# EQUIVALENT FUNCTION CALLS

# Because positional arguments, keyword arguments, and default values can all be used together, often you'll have several equivalent ways to call a function. 

# Consider the following definition for 'describe_pet()' with one default value provided:
def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):
  print(f"My pet is a {animal_type} named {pet_name}.")

# With this definition, an argument always needs to be provided for 'pet_name', and this value can be provided using the positional or keyword format. If the animal being described is not a dog, an argument for 'animal_type' must be included in the call, and this argument can also be specified using the positional or keyword format. If the animal being described is not a dog, an argument for 'animal_type' must be included in the call, and this argument can also be specified using the positional or keyword format.

# All of the following calls would work for this function:

# A dog named Willie.
describe_pet('willie')
describe_pet(pet_name='willie')

# A hamster named Harry.
describe_pet('harry', 'hamster')
describe_pet(pet_name='harry', animal_type='hamster')
describe_pet(animal_type='hamster', pet_name='harry')

# Each of these function calls would have the same output as the previous examples.

# NOTE - It doesn't really matter which calling style you use. As long as your function calls produce the output you want, just use the style you find easiest to understand.
