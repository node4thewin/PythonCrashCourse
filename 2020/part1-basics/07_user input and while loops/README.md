# USER INPUT AND WHILE LOOPS
Most programs are written to solve an end user's problem. To do so, you usually need to get some information from the user. For a simple example, let's say someone wants to find out whether they're old enough to vote. If you write a program to answer this question, you need to know the user's age before you can provide an answer. The program will need to ask the user to enter, or 'input', their age; once the program has this input, it can compare it to the voting age to determine if the user is old enough and then report the result.

In this chapter you'll learn how to accept user input so your program can then work with it. When your program needs a name, you'll be able to prompt the user for a name. When your program needs a list of names, you'll be able to prompt the user for a series of names. To do this, you'll use the input() function.

You'll also learn how to keep programs running as long as users want them to, so they can enter as much information as they need to; then, your program can work with that information. you'll use Python's 'while' loop to keep programs running as long as certain conditions remain true. 

With the ability to work with user input and the ability to control how long your programs run, you'll be bale to write fully interactive programs.
