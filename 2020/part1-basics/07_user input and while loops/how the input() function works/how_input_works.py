# HOW THE input() FUNCTION WORKS

# The 'input()' function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. Once Python receives the user's input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with. 

# For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text, then displays that message back to the user:

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)

# The input() function takes one argument: the 'prompt', or instructions, that we want to display to the user so they know what to do. In this example, when Python runs the first line, the user sees the prompt "Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ". The program waits while the user enters their response and continues after the user presses ENTER. The response is assigned to the variable 'message', then the print(message) displays the input back to the user.
