# 6-11 CITIES

# Make a dictionary called 'cities'. Use the name of three cities as keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its appropriate population, and one fact about that city. The keys for each city's dictionary should be something like 'country', 'population', and 'fact'. Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it.
