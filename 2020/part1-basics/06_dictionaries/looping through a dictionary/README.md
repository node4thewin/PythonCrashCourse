# LOOPING THROUGH A DICTIONARY

A single Python dictionary can contain just a few key-value pairs or million of pairs. Because a dictionary can contain large amounts of data, Python lets you loop through a dictionary. Dictionaries can be used to store information in a variety of ways; therefore, several different ways exist to loop through them. You can loop through all of a dictionary's key-value pairs, through its keys, or through its values.
