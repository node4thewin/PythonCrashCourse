# Importing an Entire Module (example in my_cars2.py)

# You can also import an entire module and then access the classes you need using dot notation. This approach is simple and results in code that is easy to read. Because every call that creates an instance of a class includes the module name, you won't have naming conflicts with any names used in the current file.

# Here's what it looks like to import the entire car module and then create a regular car and an electric car:

import car

my_beetle = car.Car('volkswagen', 'beetle', 2019)
print(my_beetle.get_descriptive_name())

my_tesla = car.ElectricCar('tesla', 'roadster', 2019)
print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())
