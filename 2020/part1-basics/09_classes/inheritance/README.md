# Inheritance

You don't always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class you're writing is a specialized version of another class you wrote, you can call 'inheritance'. When one class 'inherits' from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class is called the 'parent class', and the new class is the 'child class'. The child class can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it's also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.
