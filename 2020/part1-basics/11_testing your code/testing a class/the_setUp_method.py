# The setUp() Method

# In 'test_survey.py' we created a new instance of 'AnonymousSurvey' in each test method, and we created new responses in each method. The unittest.TestCase class has a setUp() method that allows you to create these objects once and then use them in each of your test methods. When you include the 'setUp()' method in a 'TestCase' class, Python runs the setUp() method before running each method starting with test_. Any objects created in the 'setUp()' method are then available in each test method you write.

# Let's use 'setUp()' to create a survey instance and a set of responses that can be used in 'test_store_single response()' and test_store_three_responses():

import unittest
from survey import AnonymousSurvey

class TestAnonymousSurvey(unittest.TestCase):
  """Tests for the class AnonymousSurvey."""

  def setUp(self):
    """
    Create a survey and a set of restponses for use in all test methods.
    """
    question = "What language did you first learn to speak?"
    self.my_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)
    self.responses = ['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin']
  
  def test_store_single_response(self):
    """test that a single response is stored properly."""
    self.my_survey.store_response(self.responses[0])
    self.assertIn(self.responses[0], self.my_survey.responses)
  
  def test_store_three_responses(self):
    """Test that three individual responses are stored properly."""
    for response in self.responses:
      self.my_survey.store_response(response)
    for response in self.responses:
      self.assertIn(response, self.my_survey.responses)

  unittest.main()

# The method setUp() does two things: it creates a survey instance (line 18), and it creates a list of responses (line 19). Each of these is prefixed by 'self', so they can be used anywhere in the class. This makes the two test methods simpler, because neither one has to make a survey instance or a response. The method 'test_store_single_response()' verifies that the first response in 'self.responses--self.responses[0]--can be stored correctly, and 'test_store_three_responses()' verifies that all three responses in 'self.responses' can be stored correctly.

# When we run 'test_survey.py' again, both tests still pass. These tests would be particularly useful when trying to expand 'AnonymousSurvey' to handle multiple responses for each person. After modifying the code to accept multiple responses, you could run these tests and make sure you haven't affected the ability to store a single response or a series of individual responses.

# When you're testing your own classes, the 'setUp()' method can make you test methods easier to write. You make one set of instances and attributes in 'setUp()' and then use these instances in all your test methods. This is much easier than making a new set of instances and attributes in each test method.

# NOTE - When a test case is running, Python prints one character for each unit test as it is completed. A passing test prints a dot, a test that results in an error prints an E. and a test that results in a failed assertion prints an F. This is why you'll see a different number of dots and characters on the first line of output when you run your test cases. If a test case takes a long time to run because it contains many unit tests, you can watch these results to get a sense of how many tests are passing.
