# 11-1 City, Country

# Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name. The function should return a single string of the form 'City, Country', such as 'Santiago, Chile'. Store the function in a module called 'city_functions.py'

# Create a file called 'test_cities.py' that tests the function you just wrote (remember that you need to import unittest and the function you want to test). Write a method called 'test_city_country()'
