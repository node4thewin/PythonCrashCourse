# Files and Exceptions

Now that you've mastered the basic skills you need to write organized programs that are easy to use, it's time to think about making your programs even more relevant and usable. In this chapter you'll learn to work with files so your programs can quickly analyze lots of data. You'll learn to handle errors so your programs don't crash when they encounter unexpected situations. You'll learn about 'exceptions', which are special objects Python creates to manage errors that arise while a program is running. You'll also learn about the 'json' module, which allows you to save user data so it isn't lost when your program stops running.

Learning to work with files and save data will make your programs easier for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and easier for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when to enter it. People can run your program, do some work, and then close the program and pick up where they left off later. Learning to handle exceptions will help you deal with situations in which files don't exist and deal with other programs that can cause your programs to crash. This will make your programs more robust when they encounter bad data, whether it comes from innocent mistakes or from malicious attempts to break you programs. With the skills you'll learn in this chapter, you'll make your programs more applicable, usable, and stable.
