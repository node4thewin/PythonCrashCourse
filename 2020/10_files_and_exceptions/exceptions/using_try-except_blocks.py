# Using 'try-except' Blocks

# When you think an error may occur, you can write a 'try-except' block to handle the exception that might be raised. You tell Python to try running some code, and you tell it what to do if the code results in a particular kind of exception.

# Here's what a 'try-except' block for handling the 'ZeroDivisionError' exception looks like:

try:
  print(5/0)

except ZeroDivisionError:
  print("You can't divide by zero!")

# We put 'print(5/0)', the line that caused the error, inside a 'try' block. If the code in a 'try' block works, Python skips over the 'except' block. If the code in the 'try' block causes an error, Python looks for an 'except' block whose error matches the one that was raised and runs the code in that block.

# In this example, the code in the 'try' block produces a 'ZeroDivisionError', so Python looks for an 'except' block telling it how to respond. Python then runs the code in that block, and the user sees a friendly error message instead of a traceback.

# If more code followed the 'try-except' block, the program would continue running because we told Python how to handle the error. Let's look at an example where catching an error can allow the program to continue running.
