# Appending to a File

# If you want to add content to a file instead of writing over existing content, you can open the file in 'append mode'. When you open a file in append mode, Python doesn't erase the contents of the file before returning the file object. Any lines you write to the file will be added at the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist yet, Python will create an empty file for you.

# Let's modify 'write_message.py' by adding some new reasons we love programming to the existing file 'programming.txt':

filename = 'programming.txt'

with open(filename, 'a') as file_object:
  file_object.write("I also love finding meaning in large datasets.\n")
  file_object.write("I love creating apps that can run in a browser.\n")

# At line 9 we use the 'a' argument to open the file for appending rather than writing over the existing file. At line 10 we write two new lines, which are added to 'programming.txt'.

# We end up with the original contents of the file, followed by the new content we just added.
