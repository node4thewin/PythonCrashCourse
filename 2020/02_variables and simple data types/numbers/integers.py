# INTEGERS
# You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integeres in Python

# Examples below are to be done while "in Python"

2 + 3

3 - 2

2 * 3

3 / 2

# Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:

3 ** 2

3 ** 3

10 ** 6

# Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in
# one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so
# Python can evalutate your expression in the order you specify. For example:

# PEMDAS

2 + 3*4

(2 + 3) * 4

# UNDERSCORES IN NUMBERS
# When you're writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores to make
# large numbers more readable:
