# 5-1 CONDITIONAL TESTS

# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates TRUE or FALSE.

# Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate TRUE and another five that evaluate to FALSE.

print("\n\tTest One")
new_car = 'truck'
print("\nWill my new_car == 'truck'? I predict True.")
print(new_car == 'truck')

print("Will my new_car == 'suv'? I predict False.")
print(new_car == 'suv')

print("\n\tTest Two")
print("\n\tTest Three")
print("\n\tTest Four")
print("\n\tTest Five")
print("\n\tTest Six")
print("\n\tTest Seven")
print("\n\tTest Eight")
print("\n\tTest Nine")
print("\n\tTest Ten")
