# 5-1 CONDITIONAL TESTS

# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates TRUE or FALSE.

# Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate TRUE and another five that evaluate to FALSE.

print("\n\tTest One")
favorite_pizza = 'pepperoni'
print("\nIs my favorite_pizza == 'pepperoni'? I predict True.")
print(favorite_pizza == 'pepperoni')

print("\n\tTest Two")

print("\nIs my old_car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(old_car == 'subaru')

print("\n\tTest Three")
new_car = 'bronco'
print("\nWill my new_car == 'bronco'? I predict True.")
print(new_car == 'bronco')

print("\n\tTest Four")
callie = 'naked'
print("\nIs callie == 'naked'? I predict True.")
print(callie == 'naked')

print("\n\tTest Five")
otis = 'pug'
print("\nIs otis != 'german shephard'? I predict True.")
print(otis != 'german shephard')

print("\n\tTest Six")
callie = 'lovely'
print("\nIs callie == 'mean'? I predict False. She is lovely.")
print(callie == 'mean')

print("\n\tTest Seven")
otis = 'pug'
print("\nIs Otis a chihuahua? I think False. He is a Pug.")

print("\n\tTest Eight")
