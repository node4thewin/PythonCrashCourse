When you understand conditional tests, you can start writing 'if' statements. Several different kinds of 'if' statements exist, and your choice of which to use depends on the number of conditions you need to test. You saw several examples of 'if' statements in the discusstion about conditional tests, but now let's dig deeper into the topic.

# SUMMARY: 
If you want only one block of code to run, use an 'if-elif-else' chain. Remember you don't have to use 'else' in that chain either. If more than one block of code needs to run, use a series of independent 'if' statements like the pizza example.
