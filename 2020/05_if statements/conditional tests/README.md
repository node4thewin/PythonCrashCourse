#CONDITIONAL TESTS

At the heart of every 'if' statement is an expression that can be evaluated as 'True' or 'False' and is called a 'conditional test'. Python uses the values 'True' and 'False' to decide whether the code in an 'if' statement should be executed. If a conditional test evaluates to 'True', Python executes the code following the 'if' statement. If the test evaluates to 'False', Python ignores the code following the 'if' statement.
