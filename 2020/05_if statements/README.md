# CHAPTER 5 - IF STATEMENTS

Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python's 'if' statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state.

In this chapter you'll learn to write conditional tests, which allow you check any condition of interest. You'll learn to write simple if statements, and you'll learn how to create a more complex series of 'if' statements to identify when the exact conditions you want are present. You'll then apply this concept to lists, so you'll be able to write a 'for' loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific value in a different way.

# SUMMARY

We learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to 'True' or 'False'. You learned to write simple 'if' statements, 'if-else' chains, and 'if-elif-else' chains. You began using these structures to identify particular conditions you needed to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. You learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a 'for' loop. You also revisited Python's style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand.

In Chapter 6  you'll learn about Python's dictionaries. A dictionary is similar to a list, but it allows you to connect pieces of information. You'll learn to build dictionaries, loop through them, and use them in combination with lists and 'if' statements. Learning about dictionaries will enable you to model an even wider variety of real-world situations.
