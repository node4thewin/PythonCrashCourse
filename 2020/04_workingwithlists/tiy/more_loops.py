# 4-12 MORE LOOPS

# All versions of foods.py in this section have avoided using for loops when printing to save space. Choose a version of foods.py, and write two for loops to print each list of foods.

my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
print("My favorite foods are:")
for my_food in my_foods:
  print(my_food.title())
