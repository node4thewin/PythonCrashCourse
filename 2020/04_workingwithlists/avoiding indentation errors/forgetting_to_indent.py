# Always indent the line after the 'for' statement in a loop. If you forget, Python will remind you:
magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
for magician in magicians:
print(magician)

# You can usually resolve this kind of indentation error by indenting the line or lines immediately after the 'for' statement. FYI THE CORRECT VERSION IS BELOW.

magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
for magician in magicians:
    print(magician)
