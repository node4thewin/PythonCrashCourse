# Chapter 9 - Classes

Object-oriented programming is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. In object-oriented programming you write 'classes' that represent real-world things and situations, and you create 'objects' based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. You'll be amazed how well real-world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.

Making an object from a class is called 'instantiation', and you can work with 'instances' of a class. In this chapter you'll write classes and create instances of those classes. You'll specify the kind of information that can be stored in instances, and you'll define actions that can be taken with these instances.

You'll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share code efficiently. You'll store your classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own proqgram files.

Understanding object-oriented programming will help you see the world as a programmer does. It'll help you really know your code, not just what's happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it. Knowing the logic behind classes will train you to think logically so you can write programs that effectively address almost any problem you encounter.

Classes also make life easier for you and the other programmers you'll work with as you take on increasingly complex challenges. When you and other programmers write code based on the same kind of logic, you'll be able to understand each other's work. Your programs will make sense to many collaborators, allowing everyone to accomplish more.

# Summary

In this chapter you learned how to write your own classes. You learned how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write methods that give your classes the behavior they need. You learned to write '_init_()' methods that create instances from your classes with exactly the attributes you want. You saw how to modify the attributes of an instance directly through methods. You learned that inheritance can simplify the creation of classes that are related to each other, and you learned to use instance of one class as attributes in another class to keep each class simple.

You saw how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need into the files where they'll be used can keep your projects organized. You started learning about the Python standard library, and you saw an example based on the 'random' module. Finally, you learned to style your classes using Python conventions.

In Chapter 10 you'll learn to work with files so you can save the work you've done in a program and the work you've allowed users to do. You'll also learn about 'exceptions', a special Python class designed to help you respond to errors when they arise.
