# Setting a Default Value for an Attribute

# When an instance is created, attributes can be defined without being passed in as parameters. These attributes can be defined in the __init__() method, where they are assigned a default value.

# Let's add an attribute called 'odometer_reading' that always starts with a value of 0. We'll also add a method 'read_odometer()' that helps us read each car's odometer.

class Car:
  
  def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    """Initialize attributes to describe a car."""
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.odometer_reading = 0

  def get_descriptive_name(self):
    """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
    long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
    return long_name.title()
  
  def read_odometer(self):
    """Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""
    print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
  
my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2019)
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())
my_new_car.read_odometer()

# This time when Python calls the __init__() method to create a new instance, it stores the make, model, and year values as attributes like it did in the previous example. Then Python creates a new attribute called 'odometer_reading' and sets its initial value to 0 (line 14). We also have a new method called 'read_odometer()' at line 21 that makes it easy to read a car's mileage.

# Our car starts with a mileage of 0. Not many cars are sold with exactly 0 miles on the odometer, so we need a way to change the value of this attribute.
