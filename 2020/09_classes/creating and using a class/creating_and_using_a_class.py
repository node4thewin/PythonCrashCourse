# CREATING AND USING A CLASS / Creating the 'Dog' Class

# Each instance created from the 'Dog' class will store a 'name' and an 'age', and we'll give each dog the ability to sit() and roll_over():

class Dog:
  """A simple attempt to model a dog."""

  def __init__(self, name, age):
    """Initialize name and age attributes."""
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def sit(self):
    """Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")
  
  def roll_over(self):
    """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

# There's a lot to notice here, but don't worry. You'll see this structure throughout this chapter and have lots of time to get used to it. At line 5 we define a class called "Dog". By convention, capitalized names refer to classes in Python. There are no parentheses in the class definition because we're creating this class from scratch. At line 6 we write a docstring describing what this class does.

# The __init__() Method

# A function that's part of a class is a 'method'. Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for nwo is the way we'll call methods. The __init__() method at line 8 is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the 'Dog' class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python's default method names from conflicting with your method names. Make sure to use two underscores on each side of __init__(). If you use just one on each side, the method won't be called automatically when you use your class, which can result in errors that are difficult to identify.

# We define the __init__() method to have three parameters: 'self', 'name', and 'age'. The 'self' parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come first before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition becuase when Python calls this method later (to create an instance of "Dog"), the method call will automatically pass the 'self' argument. Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes 'self', which is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of 'Dog', Python will call the __init__() method from the 'Dog' class. We'll pass 'Dog()' a name and an age as arguments; 'self' is passed automatically, so we don't need to pass it. whenever we want to make an instance from the 'Dog' class, we'll provide values for only the last two parameters, 'name' and 'age'.

# The two variables defined at line 10 each have the prefix 'self'. Any variable prefixed with 'self' is available to every method in the class, and we'll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. The line 'self.name = name' takes the value associated with the parameter 'name' and assigns it to the variable 'name', which is then attached to the instance being created. The same process happens with 'self.age = age'. Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called 'attributes'.

# The "Dog" class has two other methods defined: 'sit()' and roll_over() at line 13. because these methods don't need additional information to run, we just define them to have one parameter, 'self'. The instances we create later will have access to those methods. In other words, they'll be able to sit and roll over. For now, 'sit()' and 'roll_over()' don't do much. They simply print a message saying the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be extended to realistic situations: if this class were part of an actual computer game, these methods would contain code to make an animated dog sit and roll over. If this class was written to control a robot, these methods would direct movements that cause a robotic dog to sit and roll over.
