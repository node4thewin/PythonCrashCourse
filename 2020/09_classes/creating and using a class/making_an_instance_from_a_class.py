# Making an Instance from a Class

# Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance. The class 'Dog' is a set of instructions that tells Python how to make individual instances representing specific dogs.

# Let's make an instance representing a specific dog:

class Dog:
  """A simple attempt to model a dog."""

  def __init__(self, name, age):
    """Initialize name and age attributes."""
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def sit(self):
    """Simulate the dog sitting in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

  def roll_over(self):
    """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)

print(f"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.")
print(f"My god is {my_dog.age} years old.")

# The 'Dog' class we're using here is the one we just wrote in the previous example. At line 23 we tell Python to create a dog whose name is 'Willie' and whose age is '6'. When Python reads this line, it calls the __init__() method in 'Dog' with the arguments 'Willie' and '6'. The __init__() method creates an instance representing this particular dog and sets the 'name' and 'age' attributes using the values we provided. Python then returns an instance representing this dog. We assign that instance to the variable 'my_dog'. The naming convention is helpful here: we can usually assume that a capitalized name like 'Dog' refers to a class, and a lowercase name like 'my_dog' refers to a single instance created from a class.
