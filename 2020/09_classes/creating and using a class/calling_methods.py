# Calling Methods

# After we create an instance from the class 'Dog', we can use dot notation to call any method defined in 'Dog'. Let's make our dog sit and roll over:

class Dog:
  """A simple attempt to model a dog."""

  def __init__(self, name, age):
    """Initialize name and age attributes."""
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def sit(self):
    """Simulate the dog sitting in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

  def roll_over(self):
    """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
    print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")

my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)
my_dog.sit()
my_dog.roll_over()

# To call a method, give the name of the instance (in this case, 'my_dog') and the method you want to call, separated by a dot. When Python reads 'my_dog.sit()', it looks for the method 'sit()' in the class 'Dog' and runs that code. Python interprets the line 'my_dog.roll_over() in the same way.

# Now Willie does what we tell him to. This syntax is quite useful. When attributes and methods have been given appropriately descriptive names like 'name, age, sit(), and roll_over()', we can easily infer what a block of code, even one we've never seen before, is supposed to do.
