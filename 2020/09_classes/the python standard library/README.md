# The Python Standard Library

The 'Python Standard Library' is a set of modules included with every Python installation. Now that you have a basic understanding of how functions and classes work, you can start to use modules like these that other programmers have written. You can use any function or class in the standard library by including a simple 'import' statement at the top of your file. Let's look at one module, 'random', which can be useful in modeling many real-world situations.

One interesting function from the randome module is 'randit()'. This function takes two integer arguments and returns a randomly selected integer between (and including) those numbers.

Here's how to generate a random number between 1 and 6:

# >>> from random import randint
# >>> randint(1, 6)
# 3

Another useful function is choice(). This function takes in a list or tuple and returns a randomly chosen element:

# >>> from random import choice
# >>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
# >>> first_up = choice(players)
# >>> first_up
# 'florence'

The 'random' module shouldn't be used when building security-related applications, but it's good enough for many fun and interesting projects.

You can also download modules from external sources. You'll see a number of these examples in Part II, where we'll need external modules to complete each project.
