# Defining Attributes and Methods for the 'Child' Class

# Once you have a child class that inherits from a parent class, you can add any new attributes and methods necessary to differentiate the child class from the parent class.

# Let's add an attribute that's specific to electric cars (a battery for example) and a method to report on this attribute. We'll store the battery size and write a method that prints a description of the battery:

class Car:
  """A simple attempt to represent a car."""

  def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year
    self.odometer_reading = 0
  
  def get_descriptive_name(self):
    long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
    return long_name.title()
  
  def read_odometer(self):
    print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")
  
  def update_odometer(self, mileage):
    if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:
      self.odometer_reading = mileage
    else:
      print("You can't rolle back an odometer!")
  
  def increment_odometer(self, miles):
    self.odometer_reading += miles

class ElectricCar(Car):
  """Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

  def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    """Initialize attributes of the parent Class."""
    super().__init__(make, model, year)
    self.battery_size = 75
  
  def describe_battery(self):
    """Print a statement describing the batter size."""
    print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

my_tesla = ElectricCar('tesla', 'model s', 2019)
print(my_tesla.get_descriptive_name())
my_tesla.describe_battery()

# At line 38 we add a new attribute 'self.battery_size' and set its initial value to, say, 75. This attribute will be associated with all instances created from the 'ElectricCar' class bu won't be associated with any instances of 'Car'. We also add a method called 'describe_batter()' that prints information about the battery at line 40. When we call this method, we get a description that is clearly specific to an electric car.

# There's no limit to how much you can specialize the 'ElectricCar' class. You can add as many attributes and methods as you need to model an electric car to whatever degree of accuracy you need. An attribute or method that could belong to any car, rather than one that's specific to an electric car, should be added to 'Car' class instead of 'ElectricCar' class. Then anyone who uses the Car class will have the functionality available as well, and the 'ElectricCar' class will only contain code for the information and behavior specific to electric vehicles.
