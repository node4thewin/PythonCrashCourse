# DEFINING A FUNCTION

# Here's a simple function named 'greet_user()' that prints a greeting:

def greet_user():
  """Display a simple greeting."""
  print("Hello!")

greet_user()

# This example shows the simplest structure of a function. At line 5 the keyword 'def' is used to inform Python, that you're defining a function. This is the 'function definition', which tells Python the name of the function and, if applicable, what kind of information the function needs to do its job. The parentheses hold that information. In this case, the name of the function is 'greet_user()', and it needs no information to do its job, so its parentheses are empty. (Even so, the parentheses are required.) Finally, the definition ends in a colon. 

# Any indented lines that follow 'def greet_user():' make up the 'body' of the function. The text at line 6 is a comment called a 'docstring', which describes what the function does. Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes, which Python looks for when it generates Documentation for the function in your programs.

# The line 'print("Hello!") at line 7 is the only line of actual code in the body of this function, so 'greet_user()' has just one job: 
# print("Hello")

# When you want to use this function, you call it. A 'function call' tells Python to execute the code in the function. To 'call' a function, you write the name of the function, followed by any necessary information in parentheses (line 9). Because no information is needed here, callign our function is as simple as entering 'greet_user()'. As expected it prints 'Hello!'
