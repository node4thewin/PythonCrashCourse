# Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

# Sometimes you'll want to accept an arbitrary number or arguments but you won't know ahead of time what kind of information will be passed to the function. In this case, you can write functions that accept as many key-value pairs as the calling statement provides. One example involves building user profiles: you know you'll get information about a user, but you're not sure what kind of information you'll receive. The function 'build_profile()' in the following example always takes in a first and last name, but it accepts an arbitrary number of keyword arguments as well:

def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):
  """Build a dictionary containing everythig we know about a user."""
  user_info['first_name'] = first
  user_info['last_name'] = last
  return user_info

user_profile = build_profile('albert', 'einstein',
                              location='princeton', 
                              field='physics')

print(user_profile)

# The definition of 'build_profile()' expects a first and last name, and then it allows the user to pass in as many name-value pairs as they want. The double asterisks before the parameter **user_info cause Python to create an empty dictionary called 'user_info' and pack whatever name-value pairs it receives into this dictionary. Within the function, you can access the key-value in 'user_info' just as you would for any dictionary.

# In the body of 'build_profile()', we add the first and last names to the 'user_info'dictionary because we'll always receive these two pieces of information from the user (line 7), and they haven't been placed into the dictionary yet. then we return the 'user_info' dictionary to the function call line.

# We call 'build_profile()', passing it the first name 'albert', the last name 'einstein', and the two key-value pairs 'location='prinction'' and 'field='physics''. We assign the returned profile to user_profile and print user_profile.

# The returned dictionary contains the user's first and last names and, in this case, the location and field of study as well. The function would work no matter how many additional key-value pairs are provided in the function call.

# You can mix positional, keyword, and arbitrary values in many different ways when writing your own functions. It's useful to know that all these argument types exist because you'll see them often when you start reading other people's code. It takes practice to learn to use the different types correctly and to know when to use each type. For now, remember to use the simplest approach that gets the job done. As you progress you'll learn to use the most efficient approach each time.

# NOTE - You'll often see the parameter names **kwargs used to collect non-specific keyword arguments.
