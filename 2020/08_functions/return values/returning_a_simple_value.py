# Returning a Simple Value

# Let's look at a function that takes a first and last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:

def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name):
  """Return a full name, neatly formatted."""
  full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
  return full_name.title()

musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')
print(musician)
